# Audio_WaveForm_Paper_Implementation

This is an implementaion of the paper "Very deep convolutional neural networks for raw waveforms" by Wei Dai*, Chia Dai*, Shuhui Qu, Juncheng Li, Samarjit Das. Paper here --> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00087.pdf and was implemented in Pytorch.

Challenges: Google Colab session expires after 12 hours at the longest. For this reason, we ran the script on two seperate instances. The 1st three architectures [M3,M5,M11,] on the 1st instance and the last two [M18,M34] (which includes the residual block)  on the 2nd instance.
